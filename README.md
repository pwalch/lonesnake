# lonesnake

![main workflow status](https://github.com/pwalch/lonesnake/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

`lonesnake` sets up a self-contained Python environment with an interpreter and a venv in single directory. It can be used to create fully isolated Python environments for projects, as well as setting up a global Python environment.

It can be seen as a simpler variant of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for people who do not need to develop against multiple versions of Python simultaneously for the same project.

What does this tool provide compared to other tools?
* **fully self-contained Python environment**. The environment is contained in a single `.lonesnake` directory, and includes a fully isolated Python interpreter as well as a venv. It is protected against breaking updates by your package manager or you blowing up your environment in one of your projects.
* **transparent configuration and structure**. No sourcing of slow tool-specific initialization scripts. Auto-activation of venv is enabled with explicit exports.
* **easy venv setup**. No need to learn many new commands to set up a Python virtual environment. Just install `lonesnake` and run it, and you've got your environment. No previous Python interpreter is needed.

What are the limitations of this tool?
* supports installing only a single Python interpreter version at a time for a specific project
  * if you need to support multiple versions simultaneously with a fallback order, use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).
* supports only CPython 3.7+, older CPython versions and other Python interpreters (e.g. PyPy) are not supported
* supports only macOS and Linux
* consumes more disk space than tools that keep a single version of the Python interpreter in `$HOME` (pyenv, asdf), as the interpreter is copied to every project

<details>
<summary>download <code>lonesnake</code> to <code>~/.local/bin</code> or some other directory in your <code>PATH</code></summary>

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && \
  curl -sL -o ~/.local/bin/lonesnake https://github.com/pwalch/lonesnake/releases/download/0.12.0/lonesnake && \
  chmod u+x ~/.local/bin/lonesnake
```

* make sure you have `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` in your `.bashrc` (Bash) or `.zshrc` (ZSH)
* check that the script is accessible with `lonesnake --help`

</details>

## usage

**example commands**

* `lonesnake`
  * creates an environment with the latest CPython version, in the `.lonesnake` directory within the current working directory
* `lonesnake --py 3.10`
  * creates an environment with the latest patch of CPython 3.10
* `lonesnake --py 3.10.0`
  * creates an environment with CPython 3.10.0

If a `.lonesnake` directory already exists, `lonesnake` will detect it and ask for confirmation interactively before deleting it.

## automated activation

In most cases, you don't want to activate your Python environment with `source` every time you enter your project directory or use a Python command-line tool. Instead, you want it to auto-activate.

### local environment auto-activation with direnv

If you want to activate the environment automatically when you enter a project directory, you can use [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html):

<details>
<summary>install <code>direnv</code> with your package manager</summary>

```bash
# macOS
brew install direnv

# Ubuntu/Debian/Mint
sudo apt-get install direnv

# Fedora
sudo dnf install direnv

# Archlinux
sudo pacman -S direnv
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>register the direnv hook in your shell</summary>

* Bash: in your `~/.bashrc`, append `eval "$(direnv hook bash)"`
* ZSH: in your `~/.zshrc`, append `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"`

</details>

Once direnv is set up, install a standalone environment in your project and have it auto-activate:

* start a new shell
* `cd YOUR_PROJECT`
* `lonesnake` (pass a `--py` if needed, see `--help`)
* `touch .envrc` and fill it with this:

```bash
# lonesnake auto-activation for the project directory
export PATH="${PWD}/.lonesnake/venv/bin:${PATH}"
export VIRTUAL_ENV="${PWD}/.lonesnake/venv"
```

* `direnv allow`
* check that `which python` points to your project's standalone environment
  * if yes, auto-activation is properly enabled!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In case of trouble, you can get rid of the environment by running `rm -rf .lonesnake .envrc` at the root of your project.

<details>
<summary>If you often find yourself copying and pasting the project venv exports to your <code>.envrc</code>, click here to see a function to do it automatically. You can paste this function in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code></summary>

```bash
# Usage: lonesnake-print-activation >> .envrc
function lonesnake-print-activation() {
  # Print activation exports for lonesnake
cat << EOM
# lonesnake auto-activation for the project directory
export PATH="\${PWD}/.lonesnake/venv/bin:\${PATH}"
export VIRTUAL_ENV="\${PWD}/.lonesnake/venv"
EOM
}
```
</details>


<details>
<summary>If you wish to show a prefix in your shell prompt indicating whether a lonesnake venv is active (e.g. <code>üêçvenv-3.10.4</code>), some code needs to be added to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> to check for activation. Click here to show an example code, but be aware it might need adjustments depending on the complexity of your prompt config.</summary>

```bash
show_lonesnake_venv_prefix () {
  local cpython_path="$PWD/.lonesnake/venv/bin/python"
  # If the venv is activated, print the prompt prefix
  if [[ -x "$cpython_path" ]] && \
      [[ "$(which python)" == "$cpython_path" ]]; then
    local cpython_version="$(python --version | grep -Eo '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')"
    echo "üêçvenv-${cpython_version} "
  fi
}
PS1='$(show_lonesnake_venv_prefix)'"$PS1"
```
</details>

### project dependency management

After setting up auto-activation with `direnv`, project dependency management tools can easily be integrated into the `.lonesnake` directory. This section shows how to do it for some commonly used tools.

**pip-tools**

[pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)' sync command installs packages to the current venv. Therefore, all packages will be installed in the `.lonesnake` venv directory without any additional configuration:
* `cd YOUR_PROJECT`
* `pip install pip-tools`
* `pip-sync PINNED_COMPILED_REQUIREMENTS`

**Poetry**

[Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) can be integrated into the `.lonesnake` directory by specifying the `POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_PATH` environment variable:
* `cd YOUR_PROJECT` (where your `pyproject.toml` is)
* append the following to `.envrc`:

```bash
export POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_PATH="${PWD}/.lonesnake/poetry_virtualenvs"
```

* `direnv allow`
* `pip install poetry`
* `poetry install`
* check with `poetry debug` that the "Virtualenv Path" of Poetry is located in a child directory of `.lonesnake/poetry_virtualenvs`
  * if yes, Poetry is properly configured to use the `lonesnake` environment.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In case of trouble, you can get rid of the Poetry virtualenvs using `rm -rf .lonesnake/poetry_virtualenvs`.

### global environment auto-activation for a user

If you intended to use your standalone environment as a global Python environment for your user, you want it to activate automatically when you start a new shell:

* `cd ~`
* `lonesnake`
* in your `.bashrc` (Bash) or `.zshrc` (ZSH), append the following:

```bash
# global lonesnake auto-activation
export PATH="${HOME}/.lonesnake/venv/bin:${PATH}"
```

* exit your shell and start a new one
* check that `which python` points to your standalone environment
  * if yes, auto-activation is properly enabled!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In case of trouble, you can get rid of the environment by removing the export statements from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` and running `rm -rf ~/.lonesnake`.

**pipx support**

After setting up a global standalone environment, it is recommended to install `pipx` to manage Python command-line tools. Indeed, `pipx` installs all tools in isolated venvs so they don't break each other or interfere with the global environment. To install `pipx`, do the following:

* append these lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# By default, pipx stores its files in "~/.local/pipx" and "~/.local/bin", but we
# configure it to use sub-directories of the standalone environment:
# "~/.lonesnake/pipx_bin" and "~/.lonesnake/pipx_home". Thanks to this,
# we keep everything related to the global environment in the same place.
export PIPX_HOME="${HOME}/.lonesnake/pipx_home"
export PIPX_BIN_DIR="${HOME}/.lonesnake/pipx_bin"
export PATH="${PIPX_BIN_DIR}:${PATH}"
```

* exit your shell and start a new one
* `pip install pipx`
* from now on, use `pipx install` to install Python CLI tools such as `httpie`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In case of trouble, you can get rid of your pipx installation by running `rm -rf ~/.lonesnake/pipx_*` and `pip uninstall pipx`.

## standalone environment structure

This standalone environment directory includes a Python interpreter built from [source](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/), as well as a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). That is, the content of the `.lonesnake` directory is the following:
* `interpreter` interpreter directory includes `bin`, `include`, etc...
* `venv` venv directory includes `bin`, `include`, `pyvenv.cfg` etc... It is created by the interpreter above.

Behind the scenes, `lonesnake` takes advantage of cache directories for the CPython source code and build files, located at `~/.cache/lonesnake/X.Y.Z/` where `X.Y.Z` is the Python version (e.g. `3.10.1`). These cache directories enable us to skip the compilation step when the CPython code was already compiled in the past for the requested version.
